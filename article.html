            <p class="text">
                How do you balance two cultures you care about? I think about that question a lot as a Filipino-American. I was born in the US but I grew up in the Philippines. I'm currently in my fourth year in New York and I've seen myself change, become a little more American, adopt an American accent, struggle a little more when trying to converse in Tagalog. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="text">But, I've also only just spent four years here. Fast-forward a few decades and what happens? How do I try to hold on to my Filipino identity while embrace this American identity that I have grown into and can relate to on the same level?</p>
            
            <p class="text">So, I interviewed Angel Torres, Lito to his friends and family, a <i>kabayan</i> who has a similar background to mine. This is our conversation:</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> So you spent 18 years in the Philippines. Were those the first 18 years of your life?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Yeah. Born and raised, you know. I finished two years at La Salle University, at Taft, then I came to California
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Was it your family that moved?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> My dad moved here already with his family. He sent for me after he got established and actually, he was getting divorced from his second wife. Then my sister and other brother eventually followed.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> After that was it just California and then New York?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> No, California from '86 to 2003, 13, almost 14 years or something like that &#40;it was 17 years&#41;. And then it was Florida until 2012.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Was Florida for work?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Well, no. We had Ella who was about to turn 1 and Amina was on the way so their grandma lived in Florida. We decided to move there so they would help us raise raise two girls. Plus cost of living and all that. I only had my brothers in California, with two young children, we didn't have the support we felt we needed so we moved.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Throughout all of this, did you try and stay in touch with your family in the Philippines?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Yeah, at first it was hard because there was no social media. It was word of mouth and we would write to each other. There were a few phone calls here and there to greet each other during the holidays. But, as we got older, we connected through social media and we got to know each other through that. It wasn't great but still okay. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> So you connected with your family more, not right away, but a few years after your move? You already had a chance to grow and maybe become a different person. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Yeah because I was only with my dad for a year, maybe a little over a year. I was 19 or just before I turned 20 when I moved out on my own.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> How was that transition for you by the way? Spending all your life in the Philippines then having to move to a different country.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> It was hard. It was hard in the beginning because actually I didn't have the correct paperwork. My dad was, I think he was still in the process of becoming a citizen through his second wife. He brought me in without my papers yet and then tried to get me the papers when I got here. I couldn't work at first and for school, I could only take a few classes at a time because I wasn't a resident. Eventually, it got fixed. I got my all papers in order. It was rough. I was at home a lot watching TV.
                
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> So was that kind of how you immersed yourself in the culture?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> It was through TV at first. I would walk around and go out. For the most part, my dad would have a lot of Filipino friends, we would go to the parties and things like that, you know how it's like. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> You kind of had a Little Manila going on. You had that connect &#40;to the Philippines&#41; right away.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Yeah, but directly through my dad. But, he also was getting off of that already. I mean, he moved in '83 and I moved there in '86. So he had been there 3 years already. But even before that he was in Guam for work. That was kind of like transitioning that far back. Right, like late '70s. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> When you moved to Florida did you have the same kind of Filipino community?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Less &#40;Filipinos&#41; cause it's not California which has the most. Florida, there were none really. There were a few, but they were all healthcare, you know. The stereotypical nurse. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> How was that transition, culturally, for you? Because you had already acclimated to California, you had lived in the US for a bit, was it still a rough transition to Florida?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> It was a rough transition because it was suburban and very backwards. It's not as cultural, not as diverse, as urban as San Fran. Food choices and things like that are very few. Its just the malls and the beach and also, geographically it's super flat. You have to drive and in San Francisco I didn't have to drive. I'd take the Bart, the ferry, cable car, buses, I actually just rode a lot. Later on, in my twenties I rode my bike everywhere. It's different too with the family. There's like the whole house with the fence, two cars and all that. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> How as that with your family? I remember you telling me you used to try to share a little Filipino culture with your daughters. Is that something you still try to do actively? 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> They identify strongly with Filipino culture because I cooked them Filipino food, they are also close to their uncles. My brothers, my mom, my dad not so much because they lost touch but when he was still in touch with them he was also influencing them as far as Filipino culture. I would take them to Filipino restaurants, teach them to count. They're actually very sad that I couldn't teach them when they were young because they really wanted to learn how to speak it.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Was it more of a recent thing then?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> It was gradual at first. Of course, I was immersed in the culture already, I spoke the language, I knew pretty much everything about the Philippines. But, they were half Filipino and half not Filipino. I didn't try to make it about culture and push that on them until later when they were older. They started asking questions and I realized it was really important to them. They even wanted to go to Manila, they wanted to meet the family there, they were asking a lot of questions about the family there. I brought Ella there last year for the first time. She was 17 and she loved it. She totally loved it. She met her cousins and the family there. She felt a little out of place because she didn't speak it, but she didn't say it. We went in the summer, even in the heat, she was totally okay. She was just soaking it in. Amina will be the next one. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> That's good. I feel like sometimes Filipinos get clique-ish. If you don't look the part then they don't treat you like that. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Yeah, the family accepted them of course. Since I grew up there, all my high school friends, I didn't see a lot of them in 30 years and it was just like I was really just gone for a few weeks or something, you know? We reconnected easily. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> That was your first time back too, right?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> It was my first time back since 1999. Almost 20 years. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Did you notice a lot of change since you were last there? And, do you think that was Filipino culture changing or was it more viewing it through a different lense, having lived in the US for awhile?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> It's weird with me because I feel like it's almost half my life that I spent there &#40;in the Philippines&#41; and then half my life here. The earlier years count more towards the years for me, foundationally, so I felt like the culture didn't change that much. It was just the physical thing. The buildings and the roads were different, my family's all grown up, they have their own kids. But, it's still essentially the same. My mindset is, of course, you kind of have a different view of things being here &#40;in the US&#41; and then going back. But, I don't see it like, oh, it's so dirty. Like a third-world country or anything, no, I'm from there and that's how it is, it's okay. It's like I'm living in this world but I'm from that world. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Do you think it was your formative years that really stuck with you that's why when you went home, even after awhile, it felt like nothing had changed? You seemed to still be very much at home.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> That's still part of the core and then stuff just got built around it. I still speak it, even though I forget a lot of words. My accent is kind of messed a little, I'm sure after awhile it'll go away. I still understand everything. Most words, all words, I understand. But, I just forget how to say it, or how to write, you know, sentence structure, the slang, modern slang, stuff like that.  
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> I feel like that really happens if you don't speak it on a daily basis. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Or, you don't watch, like when I watched TV, that's what really helped me change and learn how you say certain words here as opposed to how we say it in Manila. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Is that how you learned?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> That's how I learned. I watched a lot of movies. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Were you fluent in English when you came here?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> I was fluent but you know, with the Manila accent. I had good foundation but they say things differently here and they call things differently here too. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Are you still trying to maintain your Tagalog vernacular? What are the things you do to stay fluent?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Sometimes I'll turn on TFC &#40;The Filipinio Channel&#41;. Or, I'll gravitate towards funny videos in Tagalog. I watched the drug show on Netflix &#40;Amo&#41;. You know, whenever I get a chance I'll talk to <i>lola</i> Melba or grandpa. If I see a Filipino store, of course it would be rude to assume that they would want to speak Tagalog, but I'll try to initiate. With friends, of course, I had friends here that used to be my high school classmates, I talk to some really close ones, like one or two in Tagalog. I don't get Rosetta Stone, I know how to speak it.
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> What about music? Do you listen to songs and Filipino artists?
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> Growing up it was American. My dad especially would take us to watch all the James Bond movies, all the American movies. And on TV, I was gravitating towards all the US shows, the music too. We didn't really listen to a lot of music growing up until I was in high school and then it was eighties alternative. I got to turned on to that. The only ones that we used to like, were Freddie Agilar, Anak, that song. That's an old, old one. A few songs here and there, pop songs that became hits that I found interesting. I didn't really connect with Filipino pop songs or movies or shows as much as the American ones. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>SL:</b> Yeah, even in the Philippines we gravitate towards Western media. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="texta">
                <b>AT:</b> The connection now with the culture that's change is how before, we were just able to hangout on the street and play with whoever. As kids we didn't really care. We would just hangout, play basketball. We're all Filipino kids, you know.
